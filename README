Andre's Pricewatch
==================

This little utility keeps an eye on the price of products in supported online shops.
If the price changes, an e-mail is sent out.

Shops included as of the time of writing:
- Amazon.de
- Saturn.de

Set up a cron job to execute the script periodically. This will get you informed
whenever there is a price change.

A cache file is written to the disk with the last known price and the time of
request for every defined product section.

# Python dependencies
- Python 3
- python-amazon-simple-product-api (pip install python-amazon-simple-product-api)
- requests
- Beautiful Soup 4

## Other requirements
A working e-mail server is needed to relay messages. You might have to adapt
the hard-coded server definition in the script file.

# Configuration file
See the included pricewatch.ini-example for a basic example of what can be done.

# Command line options
pricewatch.py [-h] [-c <config file>]

`
-h	prints the help
-c	set the path to the configuration file
`

If no configuration file is given, a `pricewatch.ini` file is searched in the script path.
